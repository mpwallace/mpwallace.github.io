<p>I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo, in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. I'm originally from the UK, and moved to Canada in 2013 to work as a postdoc at McGill University. I received my PhD from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 2012, an MSc (in statistics) from University College London in 2008, and an MA (in mathematics) from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 2007.</p>

      <p><a href="files/CV.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a copy of my CV. Sometimes it is up to date.</p>

<a id="research-interests" class="anchor" href="#research-interests" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research Interests</h3>

<p>My primary research interest is in causal inference, with a specific focus on adaptive treatment strategies and precision medicine. My work derives and explores statistical methods that use data to help inform treatment decisions tailored to individual patient characteristics.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in addressing "real-world" limitations of traditional analysis methods. These range from issues that arise from data collection (such as measurement error and unmeasured confounders), to assumptions about the structure of our data or models (such as interactions between patients), and matters of implementation (how can we involve patients in the decision-making process?).</p>

<p>I also strongly believe in the importance of good statistical communication. I have served on the editorial board of the statistics magazine <a href="https://www.significancemagazine.com/">Significance</a> for many years, and am the media representative for the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. I have given interviews on topics including workplace equity data, COVID-19, and the drawing of teams in soccer tournaments. Perhaps most (in)famously, I used stats to help me win a lot of free donuts from a Canadian coffee chain.</p>

<p>Beyond statistics I'm a big fan of trivia (especially pub trivia nights), and have appeared on a number of game shows on British television. My other hobbies are on a semi-random rotation between chess, poker, playing the piano, composing music, and video games. I am not very good at any of them.</p>
